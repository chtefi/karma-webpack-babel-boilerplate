# karma-webpack-babel-boilerplate [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chtefi/karma-webpack-babel-boilerplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chtefi/karma-webpack-babel-boilerplate)
Contains a boilerplate of a project set up for karma, webpack, babel, mocha,
istanbul.

# How to
```
npm i
karma start
```

Check `/coverage` folder then.

# Note
The coverage is based on the bundle generated by webpack. This means it contains
every crap of every dependents libs, meaning a very bad code coverage.
